This creates a 3D interactive global visualization of IR climate data

In regards to getting a WEBM video onto the globe, simply take the PNG images and render them into an mp4 in Adobe AfterEffects (but you can really do this step in any good video editing or compositing program of your choice). Then, reencode it into a WEBM using ffmpeg in the recommended settings. You can adjust this based on the quality you want the final video to be (details can be found in the online documentation, I currently have 2 types saved; HQ is 4096x2048, SQ is 2048x1024).
